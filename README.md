# equip

Node based CLI tool for common tools used in development

## Installation

`equip` comes as a binary executable if desired, otherwise can be installed as most global NPM packages can.

```console
npm install -g equip-cli
npx equip-cli
```

If linked and installed locally, then the `equip` program becomes available, otherwise npx uses `equip-cli`
as that is the package name (the short name was taken, by a deprecated project).
